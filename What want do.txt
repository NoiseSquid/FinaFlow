BASIC FUNCTIONALITY
As a user, I want to store, view, edit, and delete my financial transactions
I want to sort them by transaction type e.g. purchases, bills, expenses, et cetera.

The core of the app is just a glorified spreadsheet. Additional visualisation and
management functionality can be layered on top.
Sounds like a simple node.js & express.js based API will do. It should be basic enough
that creating a new ASP.NET or other such based API would not take long to do.
MongoDB would be overkill, a simple SQLite or JSON data store would be more portable
if I decide to host on a Raspery PI or AWS / Azure. Honestly CSVs would to the job.


ADDITIONAL IDEAS
A mobile app that can store records temporarily on the device, then batch send
them to the server once a connection is established, since the API is likely
going to run over a LAN for the foreseeable future.

Actually, CSVs would allow all data to be stored locally removing the need for a
dedicated server, but a faux server could be set up to allow the mobile app to
send it's records to the master file?



IMPLEMENTATION INITIAL SPECS
 * local SQLite file + SEE encryption for data store
 * Universal Windows Platform for the front end
 * DB interaction done within the UWP app, but written as seperate package for
   possible future porting.
